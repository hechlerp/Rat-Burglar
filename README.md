Traverse a New York subway station as one of two rats in this local co-op game. In honor of Pizza Rat, your quest is to grab the pizza and drag it from the first platform to your hole. Be careful of subways and people, as they have no respect for Ratkind and will flatten you. Squeak at the subway passengers to make them run away in panic! May your heist go off without a hitch! 

Controls: 

- Tibs, the skinny rat, is controlled with WASD to move, G to grab, and H to squeak.

- Tubs, the "less-skinny" rat, is controlled with the Arrow Keys to move, numpad 1 to grab, numpad 0 to squeak. 

- You can't squeak with your mouth full. 

- Grab is a toggle, you don't need to hold the button. 

To Run It: 

Download, extract, and start the .exe file.
